# memory-discover

Discover what knowledge is stored in the project's local memory system.

## When to Use

- At the start of a new session to understand what context is available
- When you need to find relevant project knowledge
- Before diving into unfamiliar parts of the codebase

## Instructions

1. Use the `memory_search` MCP tool with a broad query related to your task
2. Review the returned entries to understand available knowledge
3. Follow up with more specific queries as needed

## Example Queries

- "architecture decisions" - Find high-level design documentation
- "component X" - Find knowledge about a specific component
- "gotchas" - Find documented pitfalls and lessons learned
- "patterns" - Find established patterns in the codebase

## Tips

- Start broad, then narrow down
- Use domain-specific terms from the project
- Check multiple categories: architecture, components, domain, patterns, gotchas
